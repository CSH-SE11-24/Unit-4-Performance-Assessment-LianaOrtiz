How did using Bootstrap change your programming experience?

Bootstrap changed my programming experience a lot, as it has allowed me to experience a whole new world of coding. At times, its easier to use bootstrap because I can just copy and paste what componet I want. But at times it can be difficult as I cant really style some of the componets how I want.

How closely were you able to follow your MVP plan? Why or why not?

I feel like I wasnt as close to my MVP plan as I wanted, I felt it was only because throughout the project I started to slowly lose motivation. I also thought that most of the stuff I wanted to put in didnt fit the aesthetic or just didnt work out the way I wanted it to.

What features are you the most proud of?

 I am most proud of the image link cards, I wanted to do different cards cause the nromal bootstrap ones just didn't catch my eye.

 What would you add if you had more time?

I would've added more clothing to the shop, a accessories section of different accessiores as well. And just a overall more detailed online brand.
